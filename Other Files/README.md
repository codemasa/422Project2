## Some notes about our project:
* Due to some Git issues we often found it easiest to work on the project seperately and then bring any completed code to the team meeting to be compared, compiled, and commited from a single computer. 
* Adding the Google calendar API should be "easy enough" if you are familiar with Android and/or Java. This would be just for adding Google events into our app. Create a java file in the 422Project2/OnTRCK/app/src/main/java/project2/ontrck/ folder, make a reference to this file in the AndroidManifest.xml file found at 422Project2/OnTRCK/app/src/main/ and add a reference to your java file in the MainActivity.java file under the onItemClick function.

## Here are some pictures I took!
I found it easiest to take notes from team meetings with my phone.

This was our first plan for the screen and data flow.

Initially "special" one time events and "normal" repeating everyday events were going to be seperate classes.

An extra picture (I think) to be sure I got a clear shot.

A spare shot in case anything was blurry.

A cleaner view of how we intended to instantiate our array list of events.

A diagram of how we would progress through the activities in the Android app and what info we would collect at each stage.
